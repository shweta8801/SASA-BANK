                    Some people go through life without borrowing. Barring a few exceptions, almost everyone takes out a loan to buy a car, finance a home purchase, pay for a college education or cover a medical emergency. Loans are almost ubiquitous and there are agreements that guarantee their repayment. <br> <br>
                    Loan agreements are binding contracts between two or more parties to formalize a loan process. There are many types of loan agreements, ranging from simple promissory notes between friends and family members to more elaborate contracts such as mortgages, auto loans, credit cards and short- or long-term payday advance loans. <br> <br>
                    Simple loan agreements can be little more than small letters specifying how long a borrower has to pay back the money and how much interest can be added to the principal. Others, such as mortgages, are detailed documents that are filed as public record and allow lenders to take back the borrower's assets if the loan is not repaid as agreed. <br><br>
                    Each type of loan agreement and its terms for repayment are governed by both state and federal guidelines designed to prevent illegal or excessive interest rates on repayment. <br> <br>
                    Loan agreements typically include covenants, the value of the collateral involved, the terms of the guarantee, the interest rate, and the period over which it must be repaid. Default terms should be clearly detailed to avoid confusion or potential legal court action. In case of default, the terms of collection of outstanding debt should clearly specify the costs involved in collecting the debt. This also applies to parties using promissory notes. <br> <br><br> <br>

                    <h1>Purpose of a Loan Agreement</h1>
                    The main purpose of a loan contract is to define what the parties involved agree to, what responsibilities each party has, and how long the agreement will last. A loan agreement must be in compliance with state and federal regulations, which will protect both the lender and borrower should both parties fail to honor the agreement. The terms of the loan contract and which state or federal laws govern the performance obligations required by both parties will vary depending on the loan type. <br> <br>

                    Most loan contracts clearly define how the proceeds will be used. The law makes no distinctions about how to pay off new home, car, new or old debt, or how binding the terms are. The signed loan contract is proof that the borrower and the lender have a commitment that the money will be used for a specified purpose, how the loan will be repaid and at what amortization rate. If the money is not used for the specified purpose, it should be paid back to the lender immediately.

                    <h1>Other Reasons for Using Loan Agreements</h1>
                    Borrowing money is a huge financial commitment, which is why a formal process exists for both parties to produce positive results. <br> <br>

                    Most of the terms and conditions are the standard rent amount, interest charged, repayment plan, collateral, late fees, penalties for default, but there are other reasons loan agreements are useful. <br> <br>

                    A loan agreement is proof that the money involved was a loan, not a gift. This could become an issue with the IRS. <br> <br>

                    Loan agreements are especially useful when lent or loaned to a family member or friend. They prevent debate on terms and conditions. <br> <br>

                    A loan agreement protects both parties if the matter goes to court. This allows the court to determine whether the terms and conditions are being met. <br> <br>

                    If the loan includes interest, a party may want to include an amortization table, which outlines how the loan will be paid off over time and how much interest is included in each payment. <br> <br>

                    Loan agreements can accurately describe the monthly payments due on the loan. <br> <br>
                    It's safe to say that whenever you borrow or lend money, legal debt settlement should be part of the process. <br> <br>

                <p id="p4">
                <h1>Legal Terms to Consider</h1>
                All loan agreements must specify general terms that define the legal obligations of each party. For example, terms regarding repayment schedule, default or breach of contract, interest rate, loan security, as well as the collateral offered should be clearly outlined. <br> <br>

                Loan agreements include some standard legal terms that all parties should be aware of, whether the contract is between family and friends or between lending institutions and customers. There are four key terms you should know before signing a loan agreement: <br> <br>

                Choice of Law: This term refers to the difference between laws in two or more jurisdictions. For example, the laws governing a specific part of a loan agreement in one state may differ from the same laws in another state. It is important to identify which state (or jurisdiction's) laws will apply. This term is also known as "conflict of law". <br> <br>

                Parties Involved: This refers to personal information about the borrower and the lender that needs to be explicitly stated in the loan agreement. That information should include the names, addresses, Social Security numbers and phone numbers of both parties. <br> <br>

                Severability Clause: This term states that the terms of the contract are independent of each other. Thus, if one condition of the contract is held to be unenforceable by the court, it does not mean that all the terms are unenforceable. <br> <br>

                Entire contract clause: This term defines what the final agreement will be and any agreements made earlier in the negotiation, whether written or oral. In other words, it is the last saying and whatever was said (or written) before, no longer applies. <br> <br>
                </p>
               <p id="p5">
                <h1 >Interest Rate Determination</h1>
                Many borrowers in their first experience getting a loan for a new home, automobile or credit card are unfamiliar with loan interest rates and how they are determined. The interest rate depends on the type of loan, the credit score of the borrower and if the loan is secured or unsecured. <br> <br>

                In some cases, a lender will request that the loan interest be attached to physical assets such as a car title or property deed. State and federal consumer protection laws set legal limits regarding the amount of interest a lender can legally determine without considering the amount illegal and excessive usury. <br> <br>

                If the loan includes interest payments, as most do, the terms will be spelled out in the terms and conditions of the loan. Interest is either a fixed fee or a floating fee. <br> <br>

                A fixed fee, or fixed rate, loan establishes an interest rate that remains unchanged during repayment of the loans. If you borrow money with a 4% annual rate, you will pay the lender the amount owed at 4% per year until the loan is repaid. The amount of interest you pay will decrease over time as the balance is paid off and the principal payment will increase. If you borrow $200,000 to buy a home, the monthly payment will remain constant, but the portion of the payment that goes into interest and principal will change each month as the loan balance decreases. <br> <br>

                Floating fee interest rates, also called variable rate loans, carry interest rates that change over time. The amount of interest based on a benchmark rate, usually a widely followed index like LIBOR which changes regularly. Floating fee rates are adjusted periodically and are generally only used in complex loans such as adjustable-rate home mortgages. <br> <br>
                </p>
                <p id="p6">
                <h1 >     Contract Length & Amortization     </h1>
                The length of a loan contract is determined by the lender's reliance on an amortization schedule. Once the lender and borrower have determined the amount of money required, the lender will use the amortization table to calculate what the monthly payment will be by dividing the number of monthly payments and adding interest on the monthly payment. <br> <br>

                Unless there are certain loan terms that penalize the borrower for early loan payments, it is in the best interest of the borrower to pay back the loan as soon as possible. The faster the loan is retired, the less money it costs the borrower. <br> <br>

                <h1>Prepayment Fees and Penalties</h1>
                While aiming to pay off a loan early is a financially sound practice, there are some loans that penalize the borrower with pre-paid fees and penalties for doing so. Prepayment penalties are commonly found in automobile loans or mortgage subprime loans. They can also happen when borrowers choose to refinance a home or auto loan. <br> <br>

                Pre-payment penalty is applied to protect the lender, who expects a certain return on his loan in a given amount of time. For example, if the borrower repays a 5-year loan in three years, the lender will get out the interest he had expected on the loan in the previous two years. <br> <br>

                The prepayment penalty is usually 2% of the amount due on the loan or six months of interest payments. This can have a dramatic effect on the cost of loan refinancing. Many sub-prime loans include prepayment penalties, which opponents say target the poor, who are usually those with subprime loans. <br> <br>

                On the other hand there are homes financed through government-backed FHA loans. Federal law specifically forbids prepayment penalties on FHA loans. The exception is if the borrower has a mortgage that has a pay-for-sale clause and the clause is allowed as part of the mortgage. <br> <br>
                </p> 
                <p id="p7">
               <h1 >Breach or Default</h1>
               If the loan contract is paid late, the loan is considered to be in default. The borrower may be liable for a myriad of potential legal damages to indemnify the lender for any damages. <br> <br>

                 A breached or defaulted lender can pursue litigation and a court may hold the borrower liable for legal costs, liquidation damages and even property and assets attached or sold for repayment of the loan. In addition, violations or omissions of a court decision may be placed on the borrower's credit record. <br> <br>
